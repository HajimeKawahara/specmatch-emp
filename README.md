# SpecMatch-Emp

SpecMatch-Emp is a tool to extract the fundamental properties (effective temperature, radius, and metallicity) by comparing a target star's spectrum to a library of spectra from stars with known properties.

## Installation

Run `python setup.py` in the root directory. This downloads all the necessary data files and installs the command-line tools.

## Documentation

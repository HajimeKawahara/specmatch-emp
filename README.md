# SpecMatch-Emp

SpecMatch-Emp is a tool to extract the fundamental properties (effective temperature, radius, and metallicity) by comparing a target star's spectrum to a library of spectra from stars with known properties. 

## Installation

Run `python setup.py install` in the root directory. This downloads all the necessary data files and installs the command-line tools.

## Documentation

Further documentation and a quickstart walkthrough can be found at [http://specmatch-emp.readthedocs.io/](http://specmatch-emp.readthedocs.io/)

## Technical Details and Attribution

The spectral library and matching algorithm are described in [Yee et al. (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1701.00922). If you use `SpecMatch-Emp` in your research, please cite this paper.
